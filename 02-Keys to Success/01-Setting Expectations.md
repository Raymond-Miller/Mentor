# Setting Expectations

The most important thing you can do at the start of a new mentor/mentee relationship is set the expectations that you have for one another. This helps to ensure that each party is aware of the goals of your training time together, as well as the logistics of how, when, and where it will take place. Let's take a closer look at these ideas below.

### Needs Assessment

You can't be an effective mentor without first understanding exactly _what_ your student is struggling with. Obviously the goal is to pass the entrance examination, but you may find that your student understands loops way better than numpy arrays. A simple discussion of a learner's strengths and weaknesses will go a long way in making sure your training time is as effective as possible.

### Basic Procedures

For learning to occur, it's important for both you and your mentee to feel comfortable. Think back to when you were a student- how easy was it for you to ask questions when you got stuck? When and where could you reach your instructor? These issues need to be addressed on the first day, so as to ensure your mentee has the confidence to come to you when they get stuck. On the flip side, explaining your preferred method for how your mentee should reach you (as well as when is an appropriate time,) is equally vital. Everyone has limits- be approachable, but don't let them drive you crazy with questions at all hours of the night! Agreeing upon basic procedures will save you both a lot of hassle in the long run.
