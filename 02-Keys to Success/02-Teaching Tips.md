# Teaching Tips

As a recent graduate of Galvanize, you have more than enough know-how to pass the entrance examination. The question is, _how_ do you go about imparting that knowledge to your mentee? Here as some tips from the education field to help you maximize your teaching effectiveness.

### The Guide on the Side, Not the Sage on the Stage

Think back once more to your time in the classroom. When did you learn the most? Odds are, it was when you were actively engaging with the material through a project or assignment, rather than when an instructor was lecturing for an hour. Your mentee is the same way- people learn by **doing** more than watching, so let them take the lead. Set them up with an assignment, and let them walk you through their thought process- you might be surprised by how much they know! Offer hints or other help only when your mentee asks for it, and then give them a similar exercise afterward where they can hopefully apply the information on their own. After all, you won't be there to take the examination with them!

### Project Based Learning

In the vein of allowing your mentee to learn through doing, make sure that your practice activities align with the material as much as possible. A few multiple choice or short answer type questions are ok, but they should not be the main focus. You show you know how to code by _actually coding_, not by answering questions _about_ coding. Use the resources found in the Odds and Ends section if you need more active style questions.
